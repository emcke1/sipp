# Serverless Image Processing Platform

This project lets users upload an image from a small web frontend, stores it in Azure Blob Storage, and processes it with Azure Functions. The processed image is resized, compressed, and optionally converted to grayscale.

## How It Works

1. The frontend sends an image to the Azure Function HTTP endpoint at `/api/upload`.
2. The function saves the file into the `input-images` blob container.
3. A blob-triggered Azure Function processes the image.
4. The processed result is written to the `processed-images` blob container.
5. The frontend polls the processed container and shows the finished image.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 recommended
- `pip`
- [Azure Functions Core Tools v4](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- An Azure Storage connection string for local development

## Build And Run Locally

### 1. Install the Function App dependencies

```bash
cd function_app
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure local settings

```bash
cp local.settings.json.example local.settings.json
```

Then edit `function_app/local.settings.json` and set both:

- `AzureWebJobsStorage`
- `AzureStorageConnectionString`

to the same Azure Storage connection string.

### 3. Start the Azure Function locally

From `function_app/`:

```bash
func start
```

The upload endpoint will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:7071/api/upload
```

### 4. Point the frontend at the local function

Edit `frontend/app.js` and set:

```js
uploadUrl: "http://localhost:7071/api/upload"
```

You can leave `processedContainerUrl` pointing at your Azure blob container if you want the frontend to preview processed results from storage.

### 5. Start the frontend

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

## Run Tests

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pytest Pillow
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Deploy To Azure

### 1. Provision Azure resources

```bash
bash scripts/setup_azure.sh
```

This script creates:

- a resource group
- a storage account
- the `input-images` container
- the `processed-images` container
- a Linux Azure Function App

It also prints the storage connection string and generated Function App name.

### 2. Set local settings for deployment and local testing

```bash
cp function_app/local.settings.json.example function_app/local.settings.json
```

Paste the connection string printed by the setup script into:

- `AzureWebJobsStorage`
- `AzureStorageConnectionString`

### 3. Publish the Azure Function

```bash
cd function_app
func azure functionapp publish <YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_NAME>
```

After deployment, your upload endpoint will look like:

```text
https://<YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/upload
```

### 4. Deploy the frontend

Deploy the `frontend/` folder with Azure Static Web Apps or any static hosting service.

After that, update `frontend/app.js` with:

- `uploadUrl`: your deployed Azure Function URL
- `processedContainerUrl`: your public `processed-images` blob container URL

## Image Processing Rules

- Images are resized so their longest side is at most `800px`
- Output is saved as JPEG with quality `85`
- If the filename ends with `_gray`, the image is converted to grayscale

Example:

- `photo.jpg` -> resized and compressed
- `photo_gray.jpg` -> resized, compressed, and converted to grayscale

## Notes

- The frontend is a plain static app in `frontend/`
- The backend logic lives in `function_app/function_app.py`
- The local settings file contains secrets and should not be committed
